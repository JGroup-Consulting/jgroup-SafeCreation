# Allowlisting gitignore template for projects, prevents us.
# from adding various unwanted local files, such as generated
# files, developer configurations or IDE-specific-files etc.
#
#RÃ©commended: Go.AllowList.gitignore
#Ignore everything
*
# But not these files..
!/.gitignore
!Dockerfile
!README.md
!LICENSE
!.github/*
*report*
*.csv
# !Makefile
.idea
#...even if they are in subdirectories
